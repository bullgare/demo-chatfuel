This project is available on https://bullgare.github.io/demo-chatfuel/ .

It uses react, redux, redux-router, redux-thunk, react-redux-form and axios.

For testing purposes it uses jest, enzyme and moxios.

While API isn't ready, every API call has a fallback with a mock response.

It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
