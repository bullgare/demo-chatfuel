This project is available on (https://bullgare.github.io/demo-chatfuel/).

It uses react, redux, redux-router, redux-thunk, react-redux-form and axios.

For testing purpose it uses jest, enzyme and moxios.

While API is't ready, every API call has a fallback for mocking a response.

It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
